      "summary": "This image is a challenge statement for HackUTD 2025, issued by CBRE, a global real estate company. The statement outlines a significant problem faced by the industry, which is the unstructured nature of the vast amounts of data generated daily. This data includes property listings, transactions, and market reports, all of which are critical for making informed decisions regarding buying, selling, and maintaining properties.\n\nThe challenge posed to participants is to develop an AI-powered assistant that can help CBRE professionals access and trust information more efficiently. The assistant should be able to automatically find, summarize, and predict key insights from large volumes of property, market, or operational data. This would enable CBRE professionals to make faster, easier, and more reliable decisions.\n\nThe statement suggests several approaches to tackle this challenge, including document intelligence, smart search, predictive analytics, and insight summarization. It encourages participants to combine these methods or come up with their own innovative solutions."
